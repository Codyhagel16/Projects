# Welcome To My Repository
This is a repository to show off my coding skills and knowledge of various data types and structures throughout my journey in coding.
The folders are all labelled according to what the class that I was taking at the time was based around as well as some freelance 
projects that I have completed for myself. 

The repository contains elements of python, C#, React, and C++, among others. Feel free to look through each file and run any file
that interests you. A brief description of what the code is intended to do is available at the top of each file and in-line comments
are provided throughout the code to explain what each line should be doing as I understand it. 

The repository will be constantly updated with new projects that I find myself being apart of or doing on my own!

# Projects

composition and inheritance, subtyping, dynamic binding, polymorphism and dynamic memory management.

Data Structures and Abstractions: focuses on data abstraction, data structures and their implementations, the basics of 
algorithmic analysis, and the fundamental computing algorithms.

Discrete Computational Structures: focuses on finite and discrete algebraic structures relating to computers; sets, functions, 
and relations.
